# EndlessScroller

This is the first full application I made, as part of my first Programming class. It's a simple endless scroller game in the C# Console, where the goal is to clear as many levels as possible while moving from the left to the right with randomly generated obstacles.

There are a lot of things I'd change if I rewrote this app, but I'm happy with what I was able to accomplish at the time. It serves as a good comparison for me to gauge my progress as well.
